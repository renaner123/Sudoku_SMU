## SessionDescriptionHandler.peerConnectionDelegate property

A delegate which provides access to the peer connection event handlers.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
get peerConnectionDelegate(): PeerConnectionDelegate | undefined;

set peerConnectionDelegate(delegate: PeerConnectionDelegate | undefined);
```

## Remarks

Setting the peer connection event handlers directly is not supported and may break this class. As this class depends on exclusive access to them, a delegate may be set which provides alternative access to the event handlers in a fashion which is supported.
